## General information
This application creates a PacMan at a random point on screen when the appropriate button is clicked. Upon begining the animation by clicking the other button the PacMen that have been generated on screen will begin to move in a random direction at a random speed, both of which were assigned at the time of their creation. Once the animation has begun additional PacMen can be created.
